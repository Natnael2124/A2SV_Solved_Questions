lass Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        last_occurrence = {char: i for i, char in enumerate(s)}
    
        result = []
        start = 0
        max_reach = 0
    
        for i, char in enumerate(s):
            max_reach = max(max_reach, last_occurrence[char])
        
            if i == max_reach:
                result.append(i - start + 1)
                start = i + 1
            
        return result
